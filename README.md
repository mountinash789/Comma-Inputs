# Comma-Inputs
A simple js file that allows you to add a class to inputs to turn them in to comma separated number inputs.
The examples I found couldn't handle decimals. This one does.


### Usage

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="comma-number-input.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <input class="comma-number-field" id="id_number_field" />
  </body>
</html>
```
